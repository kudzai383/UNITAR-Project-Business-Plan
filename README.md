# UNITAR-Project-Business-Plan
This project is data driven. It is based on a loss management model to reduce egg production losses which are inevitable in egg production. From proven research egg production losses up to commercialization reach approximately 30% of the total produced eggs. Which means only 70% of eggs on average get to the shielf due to technical issues like breakages and standard size requirements. More over more losses are incured due to limited sheilf life and packaging breakages which translates to loss of value. A loss management solution is then required for value addition of egg breakages and meet the egg demand in the market.

## Scope of Project
Egg Processing business. Easy Egg Processing focuses on the strategy of value addition and/or Egg loss management of low demand egg produce like extra small eggs and extra large eggs
through Egg white separation from the yolk to produce liquid egg products that include liquid egg white, egg white powder and separate Yolk. These products will be called EASY-EGG.

### Summary

Though at its verge of emerging, Easy Egg will offer a totally new product in the market one which has not been seen on Zimbabwean shelves. Our strength is that we are not afraid of
spreading our wings into new things and we aim to offer the best quality of the product there ever was. The company does not only aim to be a local supplier of easy-egg but to reach out and
invade the Continental market. Easy Egg is mainly based on the health promotion of our customers which will always be a major concern for every citizen to be conscious of their health, this however will be the back born of our existence and success. It will also be based on loss management for egg producers through value addition of egg breakages, low demand extra eggs and small eggs, converting them into products with more demand based on the application. The value addition strategy is the market strategy strength to poultry egg producers for partnerships.

#### b. Legal

### Beneficiaries of Easy Egg Processing
Easy egg processing start up process will involve agreement of start up partners involved and their roles and share in Easy Egg.

### Idea Security
The start up process also involves registration of a None Disclosure Agreement document under legal guidance. This document gives Easy egg the liberty to pitch its idea and vision to potential and
interested investors and partners with closure legal agreement. Business Plan and Strategy Easy Egg Processing will use the capacity closure business mode, plan and strategy to acquire financial
support. Capacity closure business model gives us the advantages to:
1. Approach Investors providing less risk but more of real market search experience before financial closure support.
2. Approach Market (Egg producers and consumers) incapacitated with the ability to produce liquid egg products if given the go.
3. To approach potential partners with the capacity to at least buy the egg processing plant thus making ourselves the easy egg beneficiaries relevant to the partnership deal proposal. This process also involves coming up with a start up budget for Easy Egg production.

#### a. Geotargeting

The capital city Harare enbodies two of the largest egg producing companies in Zimbabwe and the largest SME egg producers in Zimbabwe. Therefore the startup initial location is favourable in Harare. In future we would like to expand to most parts of the province inorder to cover all SME egg producers. Our major expansion target over the years is to join the regional and continental export market

#### b. Competition
Since we are a partnership company our major competitor will be the normal eggs which our partners will be producing hence in actual fact our products will be competing against themselves in the market.

Liquid Egg products are a weight to weight conversion to the common table eggs. The above Product Price weight comparison reveals that on a weight to weight conversion liquid eggs and or powdered eggs are cheaper compared to the common table eggs.

### Product
We will sell high quality liquid eggs to our customers. Customers will be pleasantly surprised at how attentive we are in regards to their needs. The business operates on the assumption that it will do whatever is reasonably necessary to keep the customer happy. This reflects the notion that if the customer is kept happy; long-term profits are ensured. Our product besides being extracted from a loss management point of view it will also offer competition to the conventional egg in the market.

**Service Comparison of liquid Egg and Conventional egg**
**Size/Package:** Liquid egg sizing is a weight on weight comparison to the conventional egg.
**Price Model:** The conventional egg price is based on the grading which translates to a model based on weight or grade. Liquid Egg price is based on content irregardless of grade or size of the egg.
**Customer Needs:** The conventional egg provides all customers with a combination of the yolk and the egg white irrespective of the customer intended use of the egg. Liquid Eggs provide content specifically towards the need of the customer. If the customer wants 80% yolk of the egg content per litre that’s what liquid egg will provide. Liquid egg provides the direct need of the customer.
**Storage:** The conventional egg can be stored easily on the shelf but limited shelf life. Depending on the need of the customer Liquid eggs come in various forms that is plain product, preserved liquid egg for more shelf life and powdered egg.
