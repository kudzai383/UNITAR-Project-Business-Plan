# UNITAR-Project-Business-Plan
This project is data driven. It is based on a loss management model to reduce egg production losses which are inevitable in egg production. From proven research egg production losses up to commercialization reach 40% of the total produced eggs. Which means only 60% of eggs on average get to the shielf due to technical issues like breakages and standard size requirements. More over more losses are incured due to limited sheilf life and packaging breakages which translates to loss of value. A loss management solution is then required for value addition of egg breakages and meet the egg demand in the market. 

## Scope of Project
Egg Processing business. Easy Egg Processing focuses on the strategy of value addition and/or Egg loss management of low demand egg produce like extra small eggs and extra large eggs
through Egg white separation from the yolk to produce liquid egg products that include liquid egg white, egg white powder and separate Yolk. These products will be called EASY-EGG.

### Summary

Though at its verge of emerging, Easy Egg will offer a totally new product in the market one which has not been seen on Zimbabwean shelves. Our strength is that we are not afraid of
spreading our wings into new things and we aim to offer the best quality of the product there ever was. The company does not only aim to be a local supplier of easy-egg but to reach out and
invade the Continental market. Easy Egg is mainly based on the health promotion of our customers which will always be a major concern for every citizen to be conscious of their health, this however will be the back born of our existence and success. It will also be based on loss management for egg producers through value addition of egg breakages, low demand extra eggs and small eggs, converting them into products with more demand based on the application. The value addition strategy is the market strategy strength to poultry egg producers for partnerships.

### Team

We met each other 3 years ago in Zimbabwe before covid 19 derailed our startup plan. Our goal was to create a modern company that would provide value edition to egg losses and provide income flows to SMES by reducing commercial impact limitation brought about by supply egg size standard requiremets.

#### a. Geotargeting

The capital city Harare enbodies two of the largest egg producing companies in Zimbabwe and the largest SME egg producers in Zimbabwe. Therefore the startup initial location is favourable in Harare. In future we would like to expand to most parts of the province inorder to cover all SME egg producers. Our major expansion target over the years is to join the regional and continental export market
