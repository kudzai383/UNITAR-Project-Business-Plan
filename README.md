## Using Predictive Analysis with basic Spreadsheets to provide financial projections for Startup Businesses

Most predictive analysis tools a expensive to buy in order to calculate you break even point and most SMEs start their businesses without using proper business projections using numbers and data from the market. I have used an excel spreadsheet sheet to predict the financials for my Startup called Easy Egg. SME can use these excel tools and formulas to convince investors or banks to hen getting loans. Predictive analysis can help SME or entrepreneurs to make informed decisions on realizing when they will start to make profit based on the numbers and not a hunch. This improves business professionalism and making realistic goals. I will demonstrate the excel spreadsheet predictive analysis and its components and also pitch the startup idea based on the financials received from the predictive analysis. I used the spreadsheet to generate possible cash flow insight based on assumptions, loans, balance sheet, break even point and revenue prediction on my idea for egg processing startup. I believe the predictive analysis is the key to making the startup pitch a success as it provides a picture of the direction the business can go if given the chance.

## Application of Predictive Analysis Spreadsheet on Easy Egg StartUp idea

This project is data driven. It is based on a loss management model to reduce egg production losses which are inevitable in egg production. From proven research egg production losses up to commercialization reach approximately 30% of the total produced eggs. Which means only 70% of eggs on average get to the shielf due to technical issues like breakages and standard size requirements. More over more losses are incured due to limited sheilf life and packaging breakages which translates to loss of value. A loss management solution is then required for value addition of egg breakages and meet the egg demand in the market.

### Summary

The start up idea is backed up by data analysis and financial figures that give an insight of how the finacial cash flows will look like if anyone wants to invest in this business. It is an introduction of a new product in the market therefore requires financial projections as insights towards decision making. Easy Egg business will offer a totally new product in the market one which has not been seen on Zimbabwean shelves. Our strength is that we are not afraid of spreading our wings into new things and we aim to offer the best quality of the product there ever was. The company does not only aim to be a local supplier of easy-egg but to reach out and invade the Continental market. Easy Egg is mainly based on the health promotion of our customers which will always be a major concern for every citizen to be conscious of their health, this however will be the back born of our existence and success. It will also be based on loss management for egg producers through value addition of egg breakages, low demand extra eggs and small eggs, converting them into products with more demand based on the application. The value addition strategy is the market strategy strength to poultry egg producers for partnerships.

## Scope of Project
Egg Processing business. Easy Egg Processing focuses on the strategy of value addition and/or Egg loss management of low demand egg produce like extra small eggs and extra large eggs
through Egg white separation from the yolk to produce liquid egg products that include liquid egg white, egg white powder and separate Yolk. These products will be called EASY-EGG.

### Market
Our company will attempt to rapidly achieve awareness in Zimbabwe about its business in the first year. To be successful in this business, we should have many customers. Thus it is of great importance to have a solid marketing strategy, in order to distinguish ourselves and gain more customers.

#### a. Geotargeting

The capital city Harare enbodies two of the largest egg producing companies in Zimbabwe and the largest SME egg producers in Zimbabwe. Therefore the startup initial location is favourable in Harare. In future we would like to expand to most parts of the province inorder to cover all SME egg producers. Our major expansion target over the years is to join the regional and continental export market

Liquid Egg products are a weight to weight conversion to the common table eggs. The above Product Price weight comparison reveals that on a weight to weight conversion liquid eggs and or powdered eggs are cheaper compared to the common table eggs.

### Product
We will sell high quality liquid eggs to our customers. Customers will be pleasantly surprised at how attentive we are in regards to their needs. The business operates on the assumption that it will do whatever is reasonably necessary to keep the customer happy. This reflects the notion that if the customer is kept happy; long-term profits are ensured. Our product besides being extracted from a loss management point of view it will also offer competition to the conventional egg in the market.

**Service Comparison of liquid Egg and Conventional egg**
**Size/Package:** Liquid egg sizing is a weight on weight comparison to the conventional egg.
**Price Model:** The conventional egg price is based on the grading which translates to a model based on weight or grade. Liquid Egg price is based on content irregardless of grade or size of the egg.
**Customer Needs:** The conventional egg provides all customers with a combination of the yolk and the egg white irrespective of the customer intended use of the egg. Liquid Eggs provide content specifically towards the need of the customer. If the customer wants 80% yolk of the egg content per litre that’s what liquid egg will provide. Liquid egg provides the direct need of the customer.
**Storage:** The conventional egg can be stored easily on the shelf but limited shelf life. Depending on the need of the customer Liquid eggs come in various forms that is plain product, preserved liquid egg for more shelf life and powdered egg.

*   **Design:** Eric designs the system version. Iddo analyzes and creates the BoM.
*   **Development:** We order all needed supplies from Sannovo.
*   **Land Testing:** We check each and every part of the new Spacecraft individually.
*   **Space Testing:** All Spacecrafts travel at least once before they officially take off.

#### b. Risks

*   **Fluactuations:** Our results of operations and financial condition, as well as the selling prices for our products, are dependent upon the cost and supply of commodities and raw materials such as 
                       packaging, preservatives and eggs. 
*   **Partner Depended:** Our business could suffer significant setbacks in sales and operating income if our customers’ plans and/or markets change significantly or if we lost one or more of our largest 
                         customers.
 *   **Risks involved in fully automated processes:** Our processes can be directly affected if any segment of the plant malfunctions. The process is cohesive and cascaded so that each process depends on the 
                                                      other.
